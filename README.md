# PredictiveQA
PredictiveQA is an AI-driven test intelligence platform that analyzes build, feature, and test case trends to recommend targeted retesting. It detects script-level issues, tracks historical bugs, and predicts future failures using recent build data to reduce regression effort and improve release quality.
